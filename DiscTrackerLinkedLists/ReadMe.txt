I created a disc golf disc tracker program that utilizes linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, memory freeing, structures, pointers, and contains various functionality for client interaction. It allows the user to capture the information about multiple disc golf discs, including the disc's name, brand, category, speed, glide, turn, fade, and weight. The total weight of all of the added discs as well as the total number of discs added will be calculated.

To use and interact with this program, feel free to download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, either double-click on the "DiscGolfLinkedLists.exe" file, or you can go to the command prompt in terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory, and run the .exe file by entering the following command: 

DiscGolfLinkedLists.exe

The program will then start, and after following the simple prompt directions, the program will place the output into a new file by the name of "home1.txt". If a file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten.

During this project, I learned more about linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, structures, memory freeing, pointers, prototypes with pointers, header files, constants, helper structures, for-loops with linked lists, format specifiers, how constants need match the variable type if being placed in a variable, needing the & address symbol when scanning floats but not strings which are arrays of characters, initializing + defining head pointers and current pointers, while loops with flags, program structure for linked lists, and overall C syntax.
