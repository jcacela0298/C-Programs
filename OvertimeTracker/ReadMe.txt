I created an overtime payroll tracker program that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this program, feel free to download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, either double-click on the "OvertimeTracker.exe" file, or you can navigate to the command prompt in Terminal, move to the appropriate directory, and run the .exe file by entering the following command: 

OvertimeTracker.exe

The program will then start, and after following the simple prompt directions, the OvertimeTracker program will place the output into a new file by the name of "home3.txt". If a file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten.

During this project, I learned more about if - else statements, constants, compilation, and overall C syntax.
