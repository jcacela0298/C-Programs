I worked on a payroll tracker program that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this program, feel free to download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, either double-click on the "PayrollTracker.exe" file, or you can go to the command prompt in terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory, and run the .exe file by entering the following command: 

PayrollTracker.exe

The program will then start, and after following the simple prompt directions, the PayrollTracker program will place the output into a new file by the name of "home2.txt". If a file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten.

During this project, I learned more about the preprocessor directive known as #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS, how one cannot perform file output with Ideone (thankfully, I use VS Code and am able to perform file output), loops, how our file pointer named outputfileptr is created which points to a new file called home2.txt, the difference between %d and %i format specifiers for scanning integers, and overall C syntax.
