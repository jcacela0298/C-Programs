I worked on an overtime payroll tracker program that utilizes function calling & arrays, and contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this program, feel free to download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, either double-click on the "WageFunctions.exe" file, or you can go to the command prompt in terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory, and run the .exe file by entering the following command: 

WageFunctions.exe

The program will then start, and after following the simple prompt directions, the program will place the output into a new file by the name of "home5.txt". If a file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten.

During this project, I learned more about code neatness, function prototyles, C function calling, return types, code organization, function task delecation to functions other than main, letting the main function "make the decisions" while the other functions return the data to main, labelling end braces with comments to designate end of functions for organization & code readability, calling by reference, and overall C syntax
