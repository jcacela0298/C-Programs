I worked on a Blackjack calculator program that prompts the user for two cards and calculates the total value of both cards added together.

This program will place the output into terminal.

During this project, I learned more about how to upload a project to GitHub using Sourcetree, header files, improving readability by converting ternary operators into standard if-else statements, using system("pause") to allow the terminal to wait before displaying the total and closing immediately after, print and scan functionality, neat and meaningful comment headers, switch statements, for loops, and overall C syntax.
