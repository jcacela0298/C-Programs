I created a gross wage calculator program that contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this program, feel free to download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, either double-click on the "GrossWageCalculator.exe" file, or you can go to the command prompt in Terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory, and run the .exe file by entering the following command: 

GrossWageCalculator.exe

The program will then start, and then just follow the simple prompt directions.

During this project, I learned more about code organization, pausing the terminal after completion of the program so it does not close immediately, format specifiers, data type formatting, \t for horizontal tabbing, and basic C syntax.
