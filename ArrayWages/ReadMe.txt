I created an overtime payroll tracker program that utilizes arrays and contains various functionality for client interaction.

To use and interact with this program, feel free to download the files and make sure they are in the same folder. Then, either double-click on the "ArrayWages.exe" file, or you can go to the command prompt in terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory, and run the .exe file by entering the following command: 

ArrayWages.exe

The program will then start, and after following the simple prompt directions, the OvertimeTracker program will place the output into a new file by the name of "home4.txt". If a file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten.

During this project, I learned more about temporary variables for array loop iterations, the preprocessor command "#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS" which removes warnings to improve efficiency, how not all systems have the most up-to-date secure versions of scanf and printf which are scanf_s and printf_s, printing and scanning arrays, and overall C syntax.
