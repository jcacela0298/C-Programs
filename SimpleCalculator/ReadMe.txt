During this project, I learned more about basic C syntax, the gcc compiler, how C tends to prefer file structures without spaces, how VS Code needs to be restarted once in a while to resolve bugs, how the code section 

_____________________________________
printf("\n"); // Add a single \n here
   system("pause");
   return 0;

is a great way to finish my C programs so the program doesn't exit too quickly, how C is not object oriented, pre-processor commands for basic functionality as well as #include <stdlib.h> for system("pause")l functionality, how to rename the executable by the following command: gcc Calculator.c -o Calculator, format specifiers with an example: 

If you want 15 digits of pi stored in a float named pie, and then print 15 digits of it, do this:

float pie = 3.14159265358979323;

printf("%0.15f\n", pie);

decimal precision, minimum field with, left align and right align, (%.1 vs. %1 vs. %-), how when we want to make something constant, we add const and make the variable name all capital letters: 

const float PI = 3.14159;

scanner functionality, if statements, switch statements,
